<p>Sanjay and Arvind Seshan are the founders of
                this site. They curate the website, and
          manage all the content and collaborations. In addition to writing lessons for EV3Lessons and BOOSTLessons, the boys compete in FIRST LEGO League, mentor 100s of teams, and teach workshops/camps in several states.<br><br>

                    <br>The Seshan Brothers also like to build and program EV3 robots for fun. These robots have been featured at:
          World Maker Faire (New York), Innovation Faire (St.Louis), Pittsburgh Maker Faire, WRO Finals (New Delhi), and Maker Faire Bay Area. Their robots have also been featured on the LEGO YouTube Channel as well as publications such as The Verge and Popular Mechanics. <br>

  <h3>Our Mission:</h3>
 Like with EV3Lessons.com, our goal is to become a go-to site where all resources for BOOST, developed by the community, are readily available. Our main goal is to create a website where BOOST users can share and together. Our intention is to keep all our materials free in the spirit of everyone learning together.
