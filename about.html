  <h3>Our Mission:</h3>
  <div class="post_content group  no-skills ">				      <p>The tutorials and resources on this site are intended for all students in classrooms learning robotics, robotics clubs, scouts, and robotics teams.</p>				      <p>Our primary mission is to provide all robotics students with a good starting point for coding well. If you start right, you can learn more and do more. We think learning-by-doing is important and so we have included challenges at the end of each lesson. We also provide a complete set of lessons, from Beginner through Advanced, in a format that is concise and easy-to-use.</p>				      <p>A second mission is related to our tag line "Let`s Learn Together". Our goal is to create an environment where BOOST users can share their designs, code and ideas. Anyone who would like to make a contribution to the site is welcome.</p>				       <p> We want students to take the lessons on this site, learn from them, adapt them, add to them, and then solve your challenges by combining concepts and ideas. We provide only the building blocks for you to build upon.</p>								      <p>It is okay to:				      </p><ol>				       <li>Learn how to code</li>				       <li>Cite the person or team that showed you the technique</li>				       <li>Learn a new technique from someone else</li>				       <li>Learn something and make it even better</li>				      </ol><p></p>				      				      <p class="indent"><strong>- Sanjay & Arvind Seshan</strong></p>		                    </div>
